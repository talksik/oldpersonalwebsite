  					<p>I probably should have started this earlier, but here we go! This is my super official blog. Alright let's get a little serious. I want to discuss development insight I have on my current projects and work, explain key technical findings, and also talk about cool tech.</p>
            <p>Now, obviously the type of content throughout my blogs is going to change overtime. But for right now, I am considering to keep it quite open ended. For those of you looking for more niche topics, do not worry as I will be writing on specific software engineering/web/app development experiences. To give yourself a better picture of myself:</p>

            <p>Currently, I am a software engineering intern at Intel in an internal tools team/test automation. Our department within Intel manages the production and deliverance of Solid State drives. To get to the point, I work with visualizing test data and optimizing running of tests. In addition, my brother and I run a software service company called Lotus. We have one client currently and are building customized Customer Relations Tools for mid-sized companies. We also are expanding to include more development such as mobile apps.</p>
            <p>As with many college computer science students, I am really into hackathon competitions, as my team won top 6 at Cal Hacks and best web hack. Many of my interests lie in the idea of a startup and growing your own business using cool technologies. I am currently ideating and building out various applications to continue to learn and monetize at a later time.</p>
            <p>Thanks for tuning in to my first blog. I will be uploading more content as I get a better idea where I am going with this in terms of topics. If you would like to suggest topics according to my programming expertise, please find my contact info on the main page.
